# Claude Code Guidelines

1. **Think through the problem first.** Read the codebase for relevant files before making changes.

2. **Check in before major changes.** Before making any major changes, verify the plan with the user.

3. **Explain changes at a high level.** Every step of the way, provide a high-level explanation of what changes were made.

4. **Keep it simple.** Make every task and code change as simple as possible. Avoid massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Simplicity is paramount.

5. **Maintain architecture documentation.** Keep a documentation file that describes how the architecture of the app works inside and out.

6. **Never speculate about unread code.** If the user references a specific file, read it before answering. Investigate and read relevant files BEFORE answering questions about the codebase. Never make claims about code before investigating unless certain of the correct answer. Provide grounded, hallucination-free answers.
